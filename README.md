# TripSmart
The 7th team will develop an application that makes instant travel more accessible and stress-free for commuters and passengers within Singapore. The app does so by offering a comprehensive and practical aggregator platform to compare and select the most affordable and effective mode of transportation, according to the commutersâ€™ needs and wants. Our platform will compile the estimated travel time and fare data from multiple sources and transport modes, such as public transportation, ride-hailing and taxi services, as well as private vehicle rental firms to assist commuters in making informed choices and saving money and/or time on their journeys. In order to help Singapore achieve its vision of becoming a smart nation, we seek to streamline the transportation industry and encourage smart mobility by empowering regular commuters to openly compare the transportation options available to them.
